# NOTE: To change property values contained in this file, do not modify this
# file directly: IBM may, without warning, overwrite your changes during
# an install or upgrade.  Instead, please use an override.properties file
# that serves as a central location for modifications to Factory properties.
#
# Making a property entry in an override.properties file with your custom
# value will override the default value for that property at runtime.  If you
# upgrade the project and get a new instance of any of the Factory-supplied
# properties files your override.properties file will remain untouched.
#
# There are two different places to put your overrides, depending on whether
# or not you want the changes to affect the Factory running on the server or
# if you just want to affect the Designer experience.
#
# To affect the Factory running on the server, put your overrides inside the
# project that you want to modify, in the file
# WebContent\WEB-INF\config\override.properties
# (You may have to create this file.)
#
# To affect just the Designer experience (for all projects), you can put the
# override.properties file anywhere (outside a project), and you need to set
# the location in the Windows/Preferences page for the Factory.
#
# The same override.properties file should be used to override properties in
# any of the following properties files.
#
#   bowstreet.properties
#   cluster.properties
#   logging.properties
#   server.properties
