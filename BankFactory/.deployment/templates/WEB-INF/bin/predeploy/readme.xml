	<!--
	1. All ant scripts in the predeploy and postdeploy directories will be invoked.
		a. Pre and post hooks are called on all deployment requests.  First time and re-deploys.
		b. Default target is hit.
		c. The order of script execution is not guaranteed, so your featuresets should configure without dependenancies on one another.
	2. All config and project properties are available for your use.  Just use ${propname} syntax.
		a. project properties are in .bowstreet.
		b. config properties are in <WORKSPACE>\.metadata\.plugins\com.bowstreet.designer.webapp\deploymentconfigs
	3. Your scripts should act accordingly for all servertypes.  You may need to organize your scripts to allow for conditional
	processing depending on config type.  I.e. Tomcat does not have an admin URL.  
	4. All output is sent to ${installdir}/WPFDesigner/FeatureSets/Web-App_${version}/Deployment/antscripts/logs/${project.name}.${configname}.log  
	
	
	Pre-deploy hook: All ant xml files in WEB-INF/bin/deployment/predeploy
	Good for configuring your featureset, setting properties, updating servlet defs and mappings in web.xml, etc...
	
	
	Post-deploy hook: All ant xml files in WEB-INF/bin/deployment/postdeploy
	Good for executing XMLAccess to create users, groups, pages, place portlets, etc...
